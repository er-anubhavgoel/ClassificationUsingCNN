# Classification of Metals and Plastics using CNN

This project involves the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of metals and plastics. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images and achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between the two classes.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code to build, train, and evaluate a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is designed to classify images into two categories: metals and plastics. The project leverages several key machine learning and image processing techniques to achieve this classification.

## Goals

- Develop an accurate CNN model to classify metals and plastics from images.
- Utilize TensorFlow and Keras libraries to implement the model.
- Achieve a high accuracy rate for the classification task.
- Provide a reusable and scalable solution for similar image classification problems.

## Process

1. **Data Preparation**:
    - Images are preprocessed and normalized to ensure they are suitable for training the CNN.
    - Labels are extracted and associated with the images to facilitate supervised learning.

2. **Model Development**:
    - A sequential model is constructed using Keras, consisting of multiple convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling layers, and dense layers.

3. **Training and Evaluation**:
    - The model is trained on the prepared dataset with a specified batch size and number of epochs.
    - Performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics and validation data.

4. **Saving the Model**:
    - The trained model is saved in H5 format for future use.

## Features

- **Convolutional Layers**: Utilizes multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation functions and max pooling for feature extraction.
- **Dense Layers**: Includes dense layers for classification, with a sigmoid activation function in the output layer for binary classification.
- **TensorBoard Integration**: Tracks and visualizes the training process using TensorBoard.
- **Data Normalization**: Normalizes image data to enhance model performance.
- **Model Persistence**: Saves the trained model in H5 format for easy deployment and reuse.
